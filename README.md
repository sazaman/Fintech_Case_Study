Developer of an investment management platform intended to make investing more data-driven, transparent and impactful.

The company is funded by about $245 million from about 33 investors which include 8VC, Valcor Equity Partners, WestCap and others.  


Business Activities:

Addepar is trying to solve the way advisor are able to help either clients when it comes to investing. Their system that they have implemented is a data-driven investing. “Addepar provides customizable reporting, financial advisors can visualize and communicate relevant information to anyone who needs it. Secure, scalable, and fast, Addepar is purpose-built to power the global financial system.” (Addepar Named One of Fast Company's Most Innovative Companies) 


The companies intended customer are financial advisors and firms to help them grow as a business to be more sufficient for their clientele.  The market size of Addepar is large since it does help financial firm like Morgan Stanley, Crow Holdings Capital, Crescent Grove Advisors and many more to reach their maximum potential with their clientele.

In an interview with CRO David Lessing he states:
Addepar focuses on aggregation, analytics and reporting.  In particular, the aggregation piece is an important differentiator between us and lots of other solutions on the marketplace that focuses in a little different areas.  So in the market now there are two ways of doing aggregation, one is through screen scraping technology.  Most of the firms that are in this space use that and it’s got some issues with respect to accuracy and getting a level of data, the depth of data that is necessary to run sophisticated analytics and reporting on.  And then that is differentiated from what Addepar does, Addepar has built over the last 10 years, 250 customized proprietary data feeds into custodians of assets in the US and around the world.  And what those proprietary data feeds allow us to do is get the data at a level of depth and security into our platform, such that you can run the analytics needed to provide financial advice on a sophisticated set of holdings, as well as the flexibility to create reporting on it.  That’s a pretty key differentiator for Addepar versus some of the other technologies you hear about, whether they compete with us or not.

Up from $1.3 trillion in December 2018, the company has grown assets on its platform at an average of $10 billion per week in the past year. (Addepar, 2019)

RIA database, has validated that growth has occurred across a variety of firm sizes.

Results:

The business impact of this company has been significant.   

Some core metrics that companies in these domain use to measure success are revenue growth, working capital, return on investments, and customer retention to name a few.  
With 2 trillion assets managed in Addepar and over 400 clients using Addepar the company is performing and using these core metrics to measure their sucess.

The company performs really well when it comes to it’s competitors in the same domain.  With 2 trillion assets managed in Addepar and over 400 clients using Addepar the company is performing well.


Recommendations:


I would advise this company to be more client focused. The company seems to be more focused on the engineering mode.  

I think offering a more client friendly service will bring in more RIA clientele since Addepar strive for the success of firms and advisors.    

A service they may want to utilize is advertising more to the financial firm and advisors on how they will make their business successful.  This is an appropriate solution because it will draw in more business which will result in the company to continue to grow further.
